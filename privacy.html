    </div>

    <p>This privacy policy applies to the <strong>Bopomofo Master: Learn Zhuyin</strong> app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Florent Porrot (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Freemium service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>
    
    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information includes:</p>

        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, time spent on those pages, and game completion statistics.</li>
        <li><strong>User Accounts:</strong> If you create an account, we collect your Email Address and assign you a unique User ID to sync your progress across devices.</li>
        <li><strong>User Generated Content:</strong> If you choose to upload a profile picture (Avatar), this image is stored on our secure servers and linked to your account.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Application does not gather precise information about the location of your mobile device (GPS).</p>
    
    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Only aggregated or necessary data is transmitted to external services to aid the Service Provider in improving the Application and providing its core features. The Application uses the following third-party services:</p>
    
    <h3>2.1 Analytics (PostHog)</h3>
    <p>We use <strong>PostHog</strong> to analyze how users interact with the app (e.g., which game modes are popular, where users get stuck). This helps us improve the learning experience.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Collected:</strong> Anonymous device IDs, button clicks, game scores, and navigation events.</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Product improvement and bug tracking.</li>

    <p>We use <strong>RevenueCat</strong> to manage subscriptions and in-app purchases.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Collected:</strong> Purchase history and an anonymous App User ID. If you are signed in, this ID is linked to your account to allow you to restore purchases on other devices.</li>

        <li>We do not store your specific wake-up or practice schedule on external marketing servers.</li>
        <li>You can turn off these notifications at any time in the app settings or your device settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
    <p>The Service Provider will retain User Provided data for as long as you use the Application and for a reasonable time thereafter.</p>
